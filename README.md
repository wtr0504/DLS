# Needle: A Deep Learning Framework from Scratch

This repository contains my complete implementation for **[CMU 10-714: Deep Learning Systems](https://dlsyscourse.org/)**.  
The course provides a *full-stack* understanding of modern deep learning systems â€” from high-level framework design and automatic differentiation, down to low-level hardware acceleration and production deployment.

Throughout the course, I built **Needle**, a deep learning framework developed entirely from scratch.  
Needle supports **autograd**, **GPU acceleration**, **loss functions**, **data loaders**, and **optimizers**, and can train a variety of modern neural network architectures including CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers.

## ðŸ§© Course Overview

> **10-714: Deep Learning Systems (CMU)**  
> This course covers the fundamental building blocks of modern deep learning frameworks.  
> Students design and implement all components step-by-step, bridging the gap between *theory* and *production-level systems*.

**Topics include:**
- Computational graphs and reverse-mode automatic differentiation  
- Tensor operations and broadcasting  
- GPU acceleration using CUDA kernels  
- Neural network layers and modules (Linear, Conv2D, BatchNorm, etc.)  
- Loss functions and optimization algorithms  
- Sequence models (RNN, LSTM)  
- Transformer architectures  
- Dataset loaders, training loops, and optimization pipelines

## ðŸ§  What I Built

**Needle** is a minimalist deep learning framework that demonstrates:
- **Automatic differentiation** via a dynamic computation graph  
- **CPU and GPU backends** for tensor operations  
- **Training utilities** (optimizers, data loaders, model serialization)  
- **Neural network modules** implemented on top of the autograd engine  
- **End-to-end models**, including:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  - Transformers for sequence modeling
